- interpret data visualizations to generate a narrative about unfamiliar data  
- Compare and contrast interpretations of different visualizations from the same dataset  
- Propose questions about choices made during the data visualization process to explore potential hidden features of the data

### Develop Qs Evaluating a Whisker Plot

Come up with a set of questions to help you evaluate the clarity, usefulness, completeness, and objectivity of this whisker plot about Flu shots.

** EXAMPLE **

Some things to consider are:
  - n of participants
  - visual display
  - the statistical choices of the authors
  - any comparisons or relationships among the plotted elements

:::::::::::::: hint

### Some Hints

sample responses:
* are the data in each of the groups mutually exclusive?
* are there outliers excluded? how?
* how are the data combined to form each point & whisker plot?
* how are the CIs (confidence intervals) computed? [in this case, because the quantitative axis is % increase, CI is a little funky here as an estimate of error around the value, and not an estimate of variability within a group]
* are the number of subjects in each group equal (or approximately equal)?
* is there a grouping of interventions that suggest generalizations? (e.g. 1 text vs 2 texts, content of reminder, format of reminder)
* is there an effect of time of day that a reminder is sent/received (vs. relative to an appointment time)
* how robust are the estimates to the selection of the regression model?
* soooo, what's the takeaway from this figure? ðŸ˜„
