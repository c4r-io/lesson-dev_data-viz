Which questions would you say this visualization fails to answer?

:::::::::::::: solution

### Example responses

* are the data in each of the groups mutually exclusive?
* are there outliers excluded? how?
* how are the data combined to form each point & whisker plot?
* how are the CIs (confidence intervals) computed? [in this case, because the quantitative axis is % increase, CI is a little funky here as an estimate of error around the value, and not an estimate of variability within a group]
* are the number of subjects in each group equal (or approximately equal)?
* is there a grouping of interventions that suggest generalizations? (e.g. 1 text vs 2 texts, content of reminder, format of reminder)
* is there an effect of time of day that a reminder is sent/received (vs. relative to an appointment time)
* how robust are the estimates to the selection of the regression model?
* soooo, what's the takeaway from this figure?
